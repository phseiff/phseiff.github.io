        <span id="embedded-essays-if-js-is-enabled"></span>

        Hello! My name is phseiff, and I'm an avid hobby developer, manga-binge-reader, flexetarian, programmer, writer and denglish-speaker. This is my blog, and I'll be uploading my thoughts on various random topics and links to my programming projects here over the next months/years. You can also visit me on github if you'd like to! <p>
        Criticism of everything I'm saying, as well as issues with any of my programming projects are always welcome, as long as you don't mind me fixing them ;) <span style="color:white"> Oh, and by the way: If you can read this sentence, it means you're having your browser in darkmode; congrats for your great taste!</span>

</ul>
<p>Under the condition that you</p>
<ul>
<li>Include this license and copyright note as well as the information that it
was created by me, phseiff</li>
</ul>
<p>You may, however, <strong>not</strong> do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Say or imply the content was created by you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Print the content or otherwise transfer it into a non-digital format
including, but not limited, to stone engravings, printed paper or symbols
written in cornfields, without my priorly given explicit written permission</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Say or imply that I support your use, redistribution or interpretation of the
content</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mis-cite me or otherwise untruthfully say or imply I voiced a view or
opinion through the content (in the following referred to as "I said" or
"I deemed") even though I didn't; including, but not limited to any of
the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saying I said b even though I said that a implies b without saying I
believe a to be true</li>
<li>Saying I deemed something unnecessary even though I just said I deemed
something else more important</li>
<li>Saying I deemed something to be foo even though I just said it might be foo</li>
<li>Saying I said foo, but not explaining how I defined foo, even though I
introduced my own definition of foo before saying foo and in a way which is
clearly intended and well-positioned to be read before reading that I said
foo, if my explicitly introduced definition of foo varies from the general
public's or your audiences definition of foo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I reserve myself the right to change this license into a more liberal version
of itself in the future, with more permissions and less restrictions.</p>
<p>In case any of the above restrictions, allowances and conditions turns out to
not comply with a law applicable to it, the other restrictions and conditions
still hold true and remain unaffected, whilst the other allowances are
withdrawn (until I publish a new license mentioning the incident) if it is
legal for me to do so (as well as legally binding for you) and remain unaffected
if it is not.</p>
<hr>
<p>End of the license - everything beyond this line is not part of the license
and thus not legally binding.</p>
<hr>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you want to print the content, feel free to ask me - I believe myself
to be a very open person about this kind of requests, but I won't allow
indefinite amounts of my work printed, even though I will probably allow any
reasonable number (which might be very height, given that I usually deal with
64-bit-integers when programming. Well, maybe not <strong>that</strong> height.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The reason why I don't allow the last point of the last restriction (and why
it actually is a form of mis-citation) is that even if I said foo, saying I
did so without giving the context that I introduced an alternate definition
of foo beforehand unavoidably communicates that I hold a believe or opinion
that I actually don't and never communicated in that way, communicating that
I communicated an opinion which I never communicated. Since correct
citation is all about correctly citing the content and not the literal
letters someone published, and the content is altered even though the
lettering is correctly reproduced in the given scenario, I would consider
it mis-citation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am not a lawyer. Feel free to contact me as well as raise an issue in one
of my github repositories (after all, I am a friend of transparency) if you
feel parts of this license are legally problematic, and I will try to look
into it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you feel some parts of this license are morally problematic or make the
use or redistribution of content under this license highly unattractive for
you, feel free to hit me up on it and I'll look into it.</p>

<li>
<p>every form of werbung is an attempt into changing peoples oppinions and wishes, and since our democracy is based on people electing other people (the government) to fulfill their wishes, every tool government has to influence a the peoples wishes (using werbung) should be threated with uttermost care and regulations since such tools sum up to a negative circle: peopke voting for government to fulfill their wishes, and the elected government influencing the peoples wishes, strengthening their tendency to be elected again in a vicious circle which contradicts the fundamental principles of democracy since a democracy where being elected automatically increases ones chance of being elected again is like an economy in which becoming rich increases ones chance of becoming even richer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people elect government to get their wishes fulfilled, not to get their wishes changed; government tryign to get the people to want something they don't want at the moment equals government changing peoples wishes instead of fulfilling what they where elected for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>peoples opinions are influenced with the tax money they pay, which is certainly not in these peoples interests, since they paid it to see politicians do what they elected them for and not what they</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am aware we don't live in a direct democracy; however, the arguments I am making are not about governments changing <strong>their own</strong> oppinions after being elected (and doing things they weren't elected for or the people don't want); it's about government changing <strong>the peoples</strong> oppinions after they elected them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A parliament consists of multiple parties. If parties A and B (who hold the majority of seats together) get somethign through parliament, but party C is opposed to it and voted against it, and the government makes werbung for the the new law because they people don't like it, two issues arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The werbung is not representative for the government as a whole, since not all parties voted for the new law. Consequentially, the werbung should not be published under the governments name, but under the parties name who want to promote it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The werbung diffames the parties who voted against the change, since they look like they are part of putting up werbung for something they don't believe in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is only natural and intended for political parties to fight for power by making werbung for what they are attempting to do, but allowing government parties to make werbung for what they are doing under the disguise of making werbung for government projects (since they have a majority or are part of a majority in parliament) gives the ruling parties an unfair advantage in forming public oppinion against the opposition parties or parties that are not part of the parliament at all. Consequentially, it should be the parties who should make werbung for their projects or whatever project they believe should get werbung made, not the government.</p>
</li>
</ul>
