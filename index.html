            Hello! My name is phseiff, and I'm an avid hobby developer, manga-binge-reader, vegetarian, programmer, writer and denglish-speaker.
 This is my blog, and I'll be uploading my thoughts on various random topics and links to my programming projects here over the next months/years. You can also visit me on github if you'd like to! <p>
        Criticism of everything I'm saying, as well as issues with any of my programming projects are always welcome, as long as you don't mind me fixing them ;) <!-- span style="color:white"> Oh, and by the way: If you can read this sentence, it means you're having your browser in darkmode; congrats for your great taste!</span -->

<ul>
<li>
<p>every form of werbung is an attempt into changing peoples oppinions and wishes, and since our democracy is based on people electing other people (the government) to fulfill their wishes, every tool government has to influence a the peoples wishes (using werbung) should be threated with uttermost care and regulations since such tools sum up to a negative circle: peopke voting for government to fulfill their wishes, and the elected government influencing the peoples wishes, strengthening their tendency to be elected again in a vicious circle which contradicts the fundamental principles of democracy since a democracy where being elected automatically increases ones chance of being elected again is like an economy in which becoming rich increases ones chance of becoming even richer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>people elect government to get their wishes fulfilled, not to get their wishes changed; government tryign to get the people to want something they don't want at the moment equals government changing peoples wishes instead of fulfilling what they where elected for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>peoples opinions are influenced with the tax money they pay, which is certainly not in these peoples interests, since they paid it to see politicians do what they elected them for and not what they</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I am aware we don't live in a direct democracy; however, the arguments I am making are not about governments changing <strong>their own</strong> oppinions after being elected (and doing things they weren't elected for or the people don't want); it's about government changing <strong>the peoples</strong> oppinions after they elected them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A parliament consists of multiple parties. If parties A and B (who hold the majority of seats together) get somethign through parliament, but party C is opposed to it and voted against it, and the government makes werbung for the the new law because they people don't like it, two issues arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The werbung is not representative for the government as a whole, since not all parties voted for the new law. Consequentially, the werbung should not be published under the governments name, but under the parties name who want to promote it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The werbung diffames the parties who voted against the change, since they look like they are part of putting up werbung for something they don't believe in.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is only natural and intended for political parties to fight for power by making werbung for what they are attempting to do, but allowing government parties to make werbung for what they are doing under the disguise of making werbung for government projects (since they have a majority or are part of a majority in parliament) gives the ruling parties an unfair advantage in forming public oppinion against the opposition parties or parties that are not part of the parliament at all. Consequentially, it should be the parties who should make werbung for their projects or whatever project they believe should get werbung made, not the government.</p>

<p>The reason why I don't allow the last point of the last restriction (and why
it actually is a form of mis-citation) is that even if I said foo, saying I
did so without giving the context that I introduced an alternate definition
of foo beforehand unavoidably communicates that I hold a believe or opinion
that I actually don't and never communicated in that way, communicating that
I communicated an opinion which I never communicated. Since correct

it mis-citation.</p>

<p>I am aware that standing up against mis-citation in a license and that

<p>The Wrong Turn franchise, The Hills Have Eyes, Love Ribbon, Game of Thrones et cetera - when it comes to incest, there's a large amount of cultural reception, and it's steadily growing. And whilst all these stories have in common that there is some incest between consenting adults going on, almost none of them dares to question the immorality of what is going on within them, and neither do the viewers. Whilst recent years have brought a wave of acceptance for almost anything that hurts noone and was considered sinfull in the '50s, incest still stands as an distrubing act of renunciation from morality, humanity, good manners, nature, jesus, god and the angels as well as society and human dignity.</p>
<p>I find this pretty strange, to say the least, since, whilst I happen to have no romantic or sexual interest towards any person blood-related to me, tabooing love based purely on a persons genes and blood-relation appears like a pretty middeaval concept to me.</p>
<p>This essay aims to take a critical look of the reasoning behind this taboo - not from a historical standpoint, questioning why it developed, but from a moral standpoint, questioning whether it is worth existing or a sticky oozy relic from an ancient time, when gays where hunted and women sold at age eleven.</p>
<p><span color="red"><strong>A word of caution to prevent misjudgement:</strong> Please keep in mind that I use the term "legalization of incest", which I debate throughout this essay, to refer to the act of a government stopping to penalize incest <em>in itself</em>, not to the legalizing of <em>any</em> action involving incest. I am, for example, strongly opposed to any sexual activity involving minors, and don't defend any form of incest involving any such activity throughout this essay. Please note, additionally, that this essay deals exclusively with the topic of incest and only touches upon the topic of inbreed as nessesary, since inbreed is a different issue and beyond the scope of this article. It's also worth mentioning that I derive the legitimazy of incest out of a multitude of publical oppinions to ensure that a bright spectrum of people finds arguments to relate to amongst the ones I give, so not every argument I use is nessesarily my own oppinion.</span></p>

<p>Not only is incest frowned on, but it is also forbidden in many places. I will ignore the countries where it is penlized by death, since the immorality of such strong measurements is seldom questioned, and discussing it is way beyons this essays scope. However, I will give you a quick glance at the status quo in german law, to show how strong this social expectation is intertwined not only with our culture, but also with western law.</p>
<p>In germany as well as austria, sexual incest between blood-related siblings or people of whom one is the descendant of the other can be punished with up to 3 years of prison, per <a href="https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/stgb/__173.html" rel="nofollow">¬ß173 StGB</a> in germany, per <a href="https://www.admin.ch/opc/de/classified-compilation/19370083/index.html#a213" rel="nofollow">Art. 213 StGB</a> in switzerland, and to some extend per <a href="https://www.ris.bka.gv.at/Dokument.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;Dokumentnummer=NOR40173701" rel="nofollow">¬ß211 StGB</a> in austria, where it is called "Bluschande" ("blood shame") to further emphasice the motive of shame and sin associated with blood incest.</p>
<p>There was even a <a href="https://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/rs20080226_2bvr039207.html" rel="nofollow">decision</a> by the <em>Federal Instance Court</em> in germany as well as a <a href="https://www.hrr-strafrecht.de/hrr/egmr/08/43547-08.php" rel="nofollow">decision</a> by the <em>European Court of Human Rights</em> confirming the german state of law is compliant with the german constitution/ human rights. There has, however, always been a deep correlation between the common sense of right and wrong and court decisions. The german court decision thus doesn't particularily show these laws are morally acceptable, but that the incest ban is supported deeply enougth in our society that courts rule for it. The confirmation by the european court of human rights, on the other hand, is strongly debatable, as we'll show later on, showing that the european bias against incest goes as far as into human right courts.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legality_of_incest" rel="nofollow"><img alt="Map of incest forbiddenness" data-canonical-src="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-map.png" src="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-map.png" srcset="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-map.500px.jpeg 500w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-map.800px.jpeg 800w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-map.1200px.jpeg 1200w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-map.1500px.jpeg 1500w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-map.1800px.jpeg 1800w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-map.1974px.jpeg 1974w, " style="max-width:100%;"/></a></p>
<p>As can be seen in the map above, other countries of the world -especially wester countries who are knows for being generalyl liberal, such as the USA and middle europe- also sanctionize acts of incest. Keep in mind that this map is only regarding consenting sexual intercourse between adults, so it can't be legitimized by arguments like having to fight domestic abuse, which is actually why I chose it. It shows laws focused around incest in itself without being obfuscated by laws specifically aimed at problems (potentially) correlating with incest.</p>
<p>These facts I introduced right now show that there is a strong legal headwind against incest is extremely strong in the western world. Similary, we can assume the social aversion not only against doing incest, but also against other people engaging in incest, to be quite strong, judging by the media representation of incest (generally negative) as well as the aforementioned widely socially supported court decisions and the aversion people show towards incestuous relationships in media.</p>
<p>This consequentially sums up to two aspects: Legal oppression of any attempt to engage in incest, and social oppresion of any attempt to engage in incest, the later one done by collectively applying pressure and strong social expectation. Together, both aspects form something we call a <em>taboo</em>: Social expectations, combined with structured forcing people to follow them (in legal or social ways), to not do something.</p>
<p><strong>We can conclusively agree that incest is tabooized in our society, and now have a better gasp of how far said tabooization streches into its veins.</strong></p>

<p>Generally, when it comes to something being forbidden -and taboos effectively translate to something being forbidden by social norms-, the question is not whether there is a reason not to forbid it, the question is whether there is a reason to forbid it.</p>
<p><em>In dubio pro reo</em>, a latin sentence that roughly translates to "when in doubt, for the accused", is a common rule in jura used to describe that the assumption of innocense dominated the assumption of guit in cases of uncertainity. In germany, it is even incorporated into law. Instead of only applyng it to the mechanics of the <em>judiciary</em>, however, we could as well apply <em>in dubio pro reo</em> to the mechanics of the <em>legislature</em>, in that a law should not forbid the people -as an equivalent to the accused- to do something when in doubt about whether or not said thing is legitimate or not. Doing so extends the classicalal application purpose of the principle, yet doesn't contradict the reasoning behind it, since said reasoning could be applied to pretty much any political power within a legal <em>tripartite system</em>.</p>
<p>Another principle we can take from jura, yet still apply it to the rules of the <em>legislature</em>, is the <em>presumption of innocence</em>, which is strongly related to <em>in dubio pro reo</em>, yet of different origins and with some different nuances. Whilst <em>in dubio pro reo</em> is about what to assume when in doubt, the <em>presumption of innocence</em> is about what to assume when there is no information known at all, yet "doubt" assumes that there is something to be doubted and information to based on which one can doubt, which makes both of them different concepts. Applying the <em>presumption of innocence</em> on the job of making laws instead of the one of judging people guilty results in the principle that, if it is unknown if something violates the foundation of the constitution, as in no reasons for or against that assumption existing yet, it is to not be forbidden.</p>
<p>Both principles originate from jura, yet both can still be applied to law making since both have one foundamental thing in common: They are both about protecting the people from the government, potential misjudgement as well as despotism, and thus appliable to any power wihin a Rechtsstaat with <em>tripartite system</em>.</p>
<p>And what they teach us is that it is not required to find reasons not to tabooize incest to legitimate not tabooing it, but to find reasons to tabooize it to legitimate doing so. The preferred methology to show that a global incest ban is not justified does and should not need to lay in finding reasons to unban it, but to refute and debunk the reasons for this ban. To do so, this essay will take an entirely defensive approach, by consisting of nothing more than the concept of tower defense introduced in my <a href="https://phseiff.com/#minimalist-shadows" rel="nofollow">first essay</a> applied to common reasoning why incest should be banned. And to ensure we aren't fighting strawmen there, I will afterwards analyse the first ten pages of google search results that come up when searching for "why should incest be illegal" and show that all the arguments within these articles are covered by my tower defense - but you can skip that part if you want to ;)</p>

<p>Legal and legitimate are often used interchangably, ehough they have some notable different notations to them. Whilst <em>legal</em> refers to something being compliant with law, <em>legitimate</em> refers to something being compliant with moral, given by a moral authority or being somehow valid. In this essay, I specifically use <em>legitimate</em> to refer to something being morally flawless, as in <em>legitimated by the moral authority of constitutional concepts and concepts of natural rights</em>, and I will use <em>legitimize</em> to refer to the act of arguing for something being legitimate or to refer to something being a valid reason to assume something is legitimate.</p>

<p>Before we start, I will leave some words about laws that overshoot the target in that they sanction a whole group of behaviors of which one subset is problematic instead of that subset specifically.</p>
<p>In general, preventive laws -those who try to <em>keep people from doing something</em> rather than <em>getting them to do something</em>- are legitimized by the nessesity of preventing the sanctioned act. And sometimes, that act requires doing an other act, but is not nessesarily implied by said act, such as</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>stabbing something, which requires buying a knife, yet is not nessesarily implied by buying a knife,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>poisoning someone, which requires putting something in their drink, yet putting someone in ones drink does not nessesarily imply poisoning them, which can be shows by the existance of bartenders,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>raping someone, which requires performing sexual actions on them, yet performing sexual actions on someone does not nesssarily imply rape, since consentual sex exists.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All these cases have in common that an illegitimate thing is a subset of an other, not nessesarily generally illegitimate, thing, as shown by the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram" rel="nofollow">Venn Diagram</a>:</p>
<p><a href="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Venn Diagram" data-canonical-src="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget.png" src="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget.png" srcset="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget.500px.jpeg 500w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget.800px.jpeg 800w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget.1200px.jpeg 1200w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget.1500px.jpeg 1500w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget.1800px.jpeg 1800w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget.2000px.jpeg 2000w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget.2160px.jpeg 2160w, " style="max-width:100%;" width="wikipedia-border-image enlargeable-image"/></a></p>
<p>I will refer to a problematic subset of actions as the <em>problematic child</em> and to the set of actions these actions are a subset of as the <em>problem's family</em> for the rest of this section. To keep people from doing the <em>problematic child</em>, one can either sanction the <em>problematic child</em> specifically (to which I will refer as <em>sniping</em>) or the <em>problem's family</em> in general (to which I will refer as <em>nuking</em>):</p>
<p><a href="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-sanctiontypes.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Venn Diagram" data-canonical-src="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-sanctiontypes.png" src="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-sanctiontypes.png" srcset="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-sanctiontypes.500px.jpeg 500w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-sanctiontypes.800px.jpeg 800w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-sanctiontypes.1200px.jpeg 1200w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-sanctiontypes.1500px.jpeg 1500w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-sanctiontypes.1800px.jpeg 1800w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-sanctiontypes.2000px.jpeg 2000w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-sanctiontypes.2160px.jpeg 2160w, " style="max-width:100%;" width="wikipedia-border-image enlargeable-image"/></a></p>
<p>Generally, sanctionizing the <em>problem's family</em> instead of just the <em>problematic child</em> can be legitimated using two main arguments, these being</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>to not encourage people to do the <em>probematic child</em>, in cases where being allowed to do the <em>problem's family</em> can encourage or lead one to do the <em>problematic child</em>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>to prevent people from doing the <em>problematic child</em>, in cases where preventing the <em>problem's family</em> is easier than directly preventing the <em>problematic child</em>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I will refer to legal nukes applied to a <em>problem's family</em> based on legitimation 1 as <em>anti-encouragement nukes</em> and to those based on legitimation 2 as <em>preventative nukes</em> for the rest of this essay.</p>
<p>In general, nuking a problem instead of sniping it needs to be carefully justified, because</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>justification is needed for sanctioning something, not for allowing it, as we debated earlier this essay in the previous section, so <em>anti-encouragement nukes</em> may only be used if there is proof or good reason to assume the existence of an encouragement effect, and <em>preventative nukes</em> may only be used if there is good reason to assume that preventing the <em>problem's family</em> is easier than preventing the <em>problematic child</em>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>anti-encouragement nukes</em> have a generally somewhat bitter taste to them, since the implication that allowing people to do something legitimate might motivate them to do something forbidden and illegitimate questions the way sanctions and allowances are used for guiding people away from doing harm, as well as the concept of people being rational beings that can be dealt with using rational threats of consequences.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>groups of actions are nestled together like onions, every problem's family being part of an other family which is part of an other family etc., as demonstrated by this series of venn diagrams:</p>
<a href="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-onions.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="scale of nuking intensity" data-canonical-src="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-onions.png" src="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-onions.png" srcset="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-onions.500px.jpeg 500w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-onions.800px.jpeg 800w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-onions.1200px.jpeg 1200w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-onions.1500px.jpeg 1500w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-onions.1800px.jpeg 1800w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-onions.2000px.jpeg 2000w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-overshootingthetarget-onions.4804px.jpeg 4804w, " style="max-width:100%;" width="wikipedia-border-image enlargeable-image"/></a>
<p>Thus, the question is not only if one sanctions only the <em>problematic child</em>, or the <em>problem's family</em> as well, but also how widely one sanctions the <em>problem's family</em>; whether one just prevents the immediate requirements for a problem to occur or any remote requirements as well. The scale ranges from "sanctioning only things that are directly problematic" to "sanctioning free speech and free exchange in general to prevent people from being able to do crime". If nuking a problem (sanctioning its requirements) instead of sniping it (sanctioning the problem itself) was the default option, the default way to sanction things would be on the right-most edge of the spectrum shown above, which is not compliant with the way democracy tries to only infringe on freedom if neccessary.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>An other thing to consider is that sometimes, banning the <em>problem's family</em> causes people to request to also ban the problem's families family to ensure "equality". This reasoning is flawed, because every nuking approach (in contrary to sniping approaches) is utilitarian in its way of reasoning (in contrary to sniping approaches which deontologic in that they are motivated by natural rights as an ideal). Thus, the nuking approach is already discriminatory by design, and increasing the amount of unrightfully sanctioned things to make it less discriminatory only increases the amount of people who rights are unrightfully infringed, but extending the group of the discriminated does not decrease teh amount of discrimination. Ultimately, extending a ban on the parent group of the things it includes as a means to reduce discrimination is just one step right on the nuking spectrum I introduces above, moving towards the concept of banning everything in the wrong believe that taking from everyone without giving to anyone is the way to achieve equality. I will refer to the act of extending the range of a nuke to the parent group of the thing for which reasons to nuke it exist as the act of <em>overnuking</em> for the rest of the essay.</p>
<p>These consideration lead up to the facts that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>anti-encouragement nukes</em> as well as <em>preventive nukes</em> should only be used if neccessary,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the right way to ensure noone is unrightfully discriminated against by banning them from doing something is not to extending the range of a nuke, but to decrease it or to not use nukes at all.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These considerations sum up to the ideal of apply restrictions based on consequentialist considerations only when shown that doing so is nessesary (<em>anti-encouragement</em> or <em>preventive</em> reasoning) and to keep the range of actions and peopel affected by these restrictions as small as possible, which will be important for the rest of the essay.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Using this argument as a mean of defending a general incest-ban is based on up to two wrong assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>that incest leads to any children being born,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that children having a heighter chance of being born impaired is nessesarily a legal reason to sanctionize incest.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Assumption (1) equates incest with inbreed, the former one describing any form of sexual or even romantic interaction and the later one exclusively refering to incest involving the act of procreation. The issue with this is that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>asexual people exist, so not every couple automatically has sex,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>same-sex couples exist, so not every couple is able to create children by having sex,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>non-impreganting sexual practices exist, such as various sexual roleplays, SM-practices or anal and oral intercourse,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reliable contraception exists, so even vaginal intercourse does not nessesarily lead to impregnition,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>which shows that the mere assumption that incest has a natural, inherent and universal tendency to lead to the creation of children is flawed and such is in extension the universal incest ban if based on concerns for the potential children. One might even argue that not only is it flawed, but also problematic by being based on heteronormative assumptions and asexual erasure.</p>
<p>Assumption (2), on the other hand, is the assumption that genetically ill children need to be prevented from being brought to existence in favor of genetically healthy children. This mindset, as well as laws used to enforce its fullfillment, is called eugenic and frowned on in western europe for historical reasons as well as moral considerations.</p>
<p>In general, infringing on the peoples right to procreate can only be done if there is a legal asset to protect, a value defined by the consitution which judiciary and legislature have to be devoted to. In germany, as well as many other countries involved in WWII, eugenetics are purposefully not included in the constitution, but considerations of the well-being of offspring can still be legally taken into account by courts, as shown in the <a href="https://www.bverfg.de/entscheidungen/rs20080226_2bvr039207.html" rel="nofollow">german Federal Instance Court's decision</a>. However, decisions like these are still highly questionable and often critizised, and thus form a valid point of critizism on assumption 2.</p>
<p>One observation to make here is that germany actively discourages and even fights the sterialization of genetically or mentally disabled people, and is generally positive towards people with down syndrome, a genetical desease, having relationships or even procreating. However, a child whose mother has down syndrome has a chance around 50% of inheriting the condition, and an increased risk of other conditions, whilst a child whose parents where closely blood related, like siblings, only has a chance around 45% of carrying genetical deseases [ToDo: Sources for both]. Apparently, the right to have relationships, sex and children is</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>universally revoked for siblings because their children have an up to 45% chance of being born with genetical deseases,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>not questioned for couples with downsyndrome even though children of people with down syndrome have an up to 50% chance of inheriting the condition.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To clarify, I do not critisize that people with down syndrome have the right to procreate or enjoy sex with each other or other people whilst close relatives have not. What I am critisizing is that close relatives don't have the right to enjoy sex with each other whilst people with down syndrome have it. I am not critizising people with down syndromes to have <strong>too many rights</strong> in comparison with other people who have an increased risk of bearing children with genetical deseases, but I am critizising close relatives to have <strong>too many restrictions</strong> in comparison with other people who have an increased risk of bearing children with genetical deseases.</p>
<p>For some reasons, relatives are unanimously revoked <strong>any</strong> right to have any kind of relationships with each other based on genetics, whilst other people in similar genetical circumstances are revoked <strong>none</strong> at all. This indicates that there is a bias in jurisdictions, and that genetical deseases are not the reason, but merely a justification for banning incest, and the generalization in banning incest as a whole rather than only inbreed further strengthens this suspicion.</p>
<p>An other factor to consider when discussing assumption 2 is the negative implications of preventing inbreed as a mean to prevent genetically impacted children, namely the implications that genetically impaired children are to be prevented from existing, which is harmfull for people with genetic disabilities who fight against being abducted based on prenathal diagnostics, since any such measurements fuel a narrative focused on the prevention rather than the integration of people with genetical illnesses.</p>
<p>Concludingly, sanctioning incest to prevent mental illnesses is</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>wrong in the means, since it drastically overshoots the target by generally sanctioning incest rather than specifically sanctioning inbreed, even though incest does not nessesarily lead to inbreed, penalizing more than nessesary and thus baselessly infringing more on the right of personal self-realization than nessesary,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>possibly wrong in the ends, or at the very least regressive, since it strives a goal directly opposed to current social developements pursuing the acceptance of genetically impaired people rather than preventing them from coming to existence,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and wheather one agrees to the goal of preventing genetically impaired children from coming into existence or not, one can agree that nuking incest to specifically prevent inbreed is definitely overnuking.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>In general, traditional families -that being families roughly oriented around couples having children and the network formed by people being parents and children of each other- have different roles assigned based on relationship. For example, an aunt is a person, but it is also an abstract concept, a role assigned to a person based on the way they are related to one. Depending on the way one is related to a person, this person is assigned different forms to act towards one or, if one is a child, to participate in ones upbringing. Grandparents, for example, often fill the function of being nice to one and teaching one kindnes, as well as taking care of one when ones parents don't have time for one whilst one is a child. A grandma as a person is very different froma  grandma as a role, since one might have a person who is ones grandma ("a grandma as a person"), yet noone who fills the role of a grandma ("a grandma as a role"), for example because ones grandma is not suited for filling the role expected from her to fill. Once there are incestuous relationships within a family, the families "family tree" changes from a tree-shaped structure to a structure with circles, potentially leading to a person being related to an other person in more than one way, potentially leading to insecurities regarding the role(s) a person is expected to fill within a family. That's why we need to carefully differentiate between a person being an aunt and a person filling the role of an aunt, a person being a grandfather and a person fillng the role of a grandfather, a person being an x and a person filling the role of an x for the rest of this subsection.</p>
<p>Generally, any bads that can happen to a family can be assigned to one of four types:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>elements of the family missing (a grandpa dies, for example)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>elements of a family suddenly existing twice (a grandpa performing mitosis)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the family as a whole performing mitosis and splitting in two</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>conflict or an other negative change of mood arises in the family, but without applying 1-3.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>A bad thing to happen, something which is worse in comparison to what there was before, generally requires something to change for the worse, and since all bad changes to a family either cause <em>structural</em> changes to it (all of whom are covered by case 1-3 or combinations of them) or changes to the <em>mood</em> within it (covered by case 4), these four types are sufficient to vaguely classify any damage dealt to a family. Note that that's not to say that structural changes are inherently bad, just to say that bad things can be structural.</p>
<p>Whether the second bad I listed here really is something bad can be debated, and I would say it is not because the more, the merrier, and assuming family roles to exist twice to be be bad pretty offensive towards same-sex couples with children, but I will still include it in my reasoning to really cover most cases anyone <em>might</em> consider problematic.</p>
<p>We'll now take a look at how these bads -that's how I will call them for the rest of this subsection- can be triggered by incestuous relationships within the same family. I will ignore the issue of families starting inner conflict because they disrespect their members decision to engage in an incestuous relationship, because families not respecting a family members choices should never be a reason to forbid them to take these choices.</p>
<p>To do so, we will examine a max-sized family tree of a family with one inner-generational incest couple, and divide this family into different groups, these being</p>

<p>"Children", in this sence, includes adopted children or children brought in from an older relationship of one of the partners and not exclusively to biological children, so this issue can be discussed seperately from the issue of inbreed. Since we are talking about risks for the developement and happyness of families here, and the concept of families is distinct from the concept of blood-relationship, as shown in the very first sub-section of this section, I will only discuss incest between members of the same family, and assume incest between members of different families to not cause any more harm for both families involved than if both sides wheren't blood related, based on the restriction I made about anti-incest-minded family members not being a good reason for banning incest.</p>
<p>The following image is an exemplary family tree of a family in which two people are in an incestuous relationship with each other. It is as large as possible to be able to discuss the implications incest has on a multitude of innerfamiliar relaionships and to include as many family consteallations as possible, though I am aware that families are often smaller than that. However, the arguments I derive from the following family tree can also be appied to every subtree and smaller tree, which is why I chose to do them on a pretty big one. I am also aware that families with non-monogamous couples exist, though I won't discuss these for reasons I will explain later on. Some degrees of relatives are not even shown in the tree, such as potential spouses of the parent's siblings and generally every kind of family members whose relationship to the incestuous couple has no special english word for it, since I consider these family members to be to distantly related to the incestuous couple to be affected enough by their actions to have a say about their legitimity. The grandchildren of the incestuous couple are also not included, since they will likely never meet their grand-grand-parents and will thus not be actively confronted with the common herritage of their grandparents:</p>
<p><a href="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="family tree" data-canonical-src="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree.png" src="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree.png" srcset="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree.500px.jpeg 500w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree.800px.jpeg 800w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree.1200px.jpeg 1200w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree.1500px.jpeg 1500w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree.1800px.jpeg 1800w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree.2000px.jpeg 2000w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree.4080px.jpeg 4080w, " style="max-width:100%;" width="wikipedia-border-image enlargeable-image"/></a></p>
<p>This family tree does not specify the second person in the relationship, as we will iterate over multiple possible ways both sides could be related to each other. We will, however, ignore relationships between people and their descendants, since these are in a one-sided dependency relationship with each other and relationships with people who depend on one are not things I will defend in here, and are problematic for a multitude of obvious non-incest-related reasons. in case you need help with the nomenclature of family relations, I used <a href="https://static.onecms.io/wp-content/uploads/pdfs/sites/37/2019/06/06230238/bhg-cousins-chart-family-relationships.pdf" rel="nofollow">this</a> chart to understand them.</p>

<li>
<p><strong>Incest with sibling</strong>:</p>
<p>The following exemplary family tree shall serve as an example family tree for this sort of incest:</p>
<a href="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree-siblings.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="sibling-incest family tree" data-canonical-src="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree-siblings.png" src="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree-siblings.png" srcset="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree-siblings.500px.jpeg 500w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree-siblings.800px.jpeg 800w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree-siblings.1200px.jpeg 1200w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree-siblings.1500px.jpeg 1500w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree-siblings.1800px.jpeg 1800w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree-siblings.2000px.jpeg 2000w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-tree-siblings.4080px.jpeg 4080w, " style="max-width:100%;" width="wikipedia-border-image enlargeable-image"/></a>
<p>Let's see which bads are -technically- fulfilled by that form of incest!</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>"bad no. 1"</strong> is technically fulfilled, because some family members will experience missing relatives and positions they might have expected or wished to exist within their family. Which relatives are missing for which family member is shown below:</p>
<a href="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-deletions-siblings.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="sibling-incest caused deletions" data-canonical-src="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-deletions-siblings.png" src="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-deletions-siblings.png" srcset="/phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-deletions-siblings.500px.jpeg 500w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-deletions-siblings.800px.jpeg 800w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-deletions-siblings.1200px.jpeg 1200w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-deletions-siblings.1500px.jpeg 1500w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-deletions-siblings.1800px.jpeg 1800w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-deletions-siblings.2000px.jpeg 2000w, /phseiff-essays/images/incest-taboo-families-deletions-siblings.3243px.jpeg 3243w, " style="max-width:100%;" width="wikipedia-border-image enlargeable-image"/></a>
<p>As we can see, the only people whose wellbeing is affected insofar as they miss some close relatives are the couples chldren, and even their wellbeing is not impaired any more than the wellbeing of children with one parent who doesn't have a living family.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>"bad no. 2"</strong> is fulfilled as well, since some family members will experience having relatives fill more than one position in their family due to their family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)" rel="nofollow">tree</a> becoming a family <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undirected_graph" rel="nofollow">graph</a>:</p>

<p>The issue of children having relatives fill more than one family role in their life was one of the reasons stated by the [...] for justifying the german incest ban, regardless of the fact that most couples don't bear/adopt any children, and as we can see, it is mainly unjustified, since [...]</p>
<p>&lt;-- write on here</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As we can see, any problem caused to families by incest is</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>not actually caused by incest, but by two people from the same family having a relationship with each other,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>only affecting the incestuous couples children in a meaningfull way, and in ways that are similary present in couples where one or both sides have a small family or none at all, yet relationships with people that have small families are not sanctioned the same way incest is.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The way the incest ban is sometimes justified by using "the protection of families" as an argument is heighly problematic, because it is based on the expectation that every family whose role systems deviate from a "traditional" familie's role system is automatically disfunctional, the exception that families and children should be protected from non-traditional families, that two parents, two sets of grandparents and two sets of aunts and uncles are cruicial for a families wellbeing and a healthy upbringing, and the incest ban being legitimated by this concept further fuels this concept back. The fact that small families, families with only one parent as well as families with one parent who is an orphant and thus not bringing their own family into the relationship exist and all raise healthy children is completely ignored by these laws, and laws enforcing traditional family constellations to "protect the children and our values" actively spit on these families. The fact that couples don't nessesarily have cildren that need to be protected from their way of living is also comoletely ignored by this incest-ban-justification, further adding to the problematic short-sightedness and ignorance about the many ways of living and happyness people can find that laws like these display.</p>
<p>Protecting familes means giving them the soil they need for growing healthy, not to cut of every leaf one deams unhealthy by ones own definition of how families should sprout.</p>
<p>(claim that blood-related does not equal family, as shows before, and stopping blood-related incest does not prevent this from happening. Claim that stopping people from entering relationships for the sake of their family follows a similarily evil malicious logic as stopping people from divorcing or moving away from their family to protect families; reducing the right of censenting people to do what they want to stop them from messing up their family relationships is in no way a legitimate way to protect families, since said restrictions, if relevant, cut deeply into their private life, which is exactly the opposite of what protecting families means. Also mention the existance of rainbow-families and patchwork-families as well as families with no grandparents or single parent, and mention how these non-traditional types of families where there is no classical "mother, father, grandparents adn children"-model never hurt anyones developement and where never sanctioned or fought against by laws in recent times.

</blockquote>
<p>This argument is highly similar to the first one we debunked, the one that child abuse usually happens within families, but goes the other way around. And contrary to its twin sibling, it is easily debunked, because it is not only used to draw the wrong conclusions, but also based on wrong assumptions.</p>
<p>To be more specific, the reason why most incestuous relationships are child abuse or otherwise abusive is not incest, but the incest ban itself, since</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>secret abusive relationships have a heighter chance of becoming known of than secret non-abusive relationships, since the abused might turn against the abuser, flee or be ble to talk about their experiences when they are adults. This means that incestuous relationships have a heighter chance of getting known of if they are abusive or child abusive, increasing the statistic at debate. Once incest is legalized, this will rapidly drop.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>as long as incest is illegal and tabooed, the only people who dare engage in incest are ones who dare break laws and taboos. The same goes people who abuse their children, since listening to laws and taboos is fundamentally incompatible with abusive behavior towards children. This automatically causes an enlarged overlap between people who engage in incest and child abusers, simply because people who take laws in themselves as a reason to refrain from cetain actions will neither do any of both. Once incest is legalized, said overlap will disappear.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, the reasoning I applied to this arguments sibling-argument are applyable to this argument as well, in addition to the point I made above, making this the weaker sibling.</p>

<p>Incest with ones daughter is not explicitely mentioned, but it is assumed that it was either intended to be implied or lost during transcription, and even if we take the bible word by word, the rule to not do incest with ones parent can be extended to incest between parents and children being prohibited if one takes the fact that sex must be consentual to be acceptable into account. The book leviticus also doesn't mention incest with ones brother or uncle, but mostly because it was originally written for a male aufdience and gay relationships where, sadly, not expected back then. To be more specific, Leviticus also states that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>sex between men is a sin punnisheable only by death. <span color="#000000">(Leviticus 20:13, and partly Leviticus 18:22)</span></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We should, quite obviously, not take a book that openly encourages the death sentence for queer people too seriously, and we should obviously refrain from assuming a book with open homophobia in it to be a good moral authority.</p>
<p>Additionally, most european states are sekular, some even laicistic, and most countries of our free world don't have the bible as a guide for what to sanction and what not to sanction in their constitution; what happens when one copies from the bible into law can be seen in Afghanistan (Sharia law) and other countries, and usually isn't good.</p>
<p>Taking the bible as an argument for sanctioning incest should thus be considered a heighly problematic standpoint for political, juristic as well as moral reasons.</p>

<p>As we can see, not all arguments against incest legalization are nessesarily baseless. However, we can still make out a division between two types of arguments,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>those that are inherently problematic in themselves, based on wrong assuptions or targeting questionable ideals,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>those that voice legitimate concerns that (might) need to legally addressed, but to whom generally banning incest is too broad of an answer, overshooting the target, infringing on too many rights and generally the less favorable answer compared to more specific approaches sanctioning the issue in question instead of incest in general.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>We will thus iterate over all these concerns and show which one are of type 2 and how they can be addressed in the next section.</p>

<p>Whilst we might now have a gasp at why the reasons stated above are not good reasons for sanctioning incest, some of them still word legitimate concerns with unconditionally lifting the incest ban. We will thus now iterate over all these arguments and show possible legal alternatives to a universal incest ban that still address these issues.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Even if incest was no longer illegal in itself, child abuse and abuse in general will still be illegal, so there is no particular law adjustment required to address this issue.</p>
<p>Extending our common definiton of child abuse, one might count relationships between parents and their adult children or inter-generational incestuous relationships in general as naturally abusive, which is a reasonable interpretation since these are asymmetrical dependant relationships. However, the measurements suggested in part (vi) of this section would suffice to address this issue.</p>
</li>

</blockquote>
<p>Preventing genetical deseases by means of eugenetics and deciding who is allowed to mate and who is a goal of the german government and explicitely frowned on by the german constitution as well as our society for well-known historical reasons. And even if it wasn't or one has a different oppinion, or in countries with a different set of values regarding this issue, genetical deseases caused by incest could be easily prevented by</p>
<ul width="scales"><li>legally sanctionizing inbreed</li></ul>
<p>If one assumes the legalization of incest to necessarily leed to people illegally having children, which, as shown in the section "About laws overshooting the target", would be quite problematic without strong evidence, one could still</p>
<ul width="scales"><li>legally sanction incest between fertile opposite-sex couples</li></ul>
<p>which would only affect those for whom the risk of breaking the inbreeding-ban actually exists, though it is defenitely not <em>preventative nuking</em> since inbreed is easier to prevent than incest, and wheather it is <em>anti-encouragement nuking</em> can be heighly debated. One could, of cause, also argue to</p>
<ul width="scales"><li>legally sanction incest in general</li></ul>
<p>to prevent inbreed as it is currently done, but that would be overnuking and thus inherently problematic as shown.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As stated above, this "thread" is somewhere between trivial, already existant independently of incest and beyond the realms of what government should get itseklf involved in. And even if government wanted to fight this thread, it could easily do so doing either or both of</p>
<ul width="scales">
<li>legally sanctioning incest between people who grew up in the same family</li>
<li>legally sanctioning incest between people who lived in the same household as part of the same family even before entering a relationship</li>
</ul>
<p>to not overnuke the target.</p>
<p>These measurements would require a definition of what is a family and what is not, requiring well-defined boundaries which are difficult to define considering that "family" and "blood related group of people" are two different concepts. This is, however, acceptable, since having the protection of families as an objective of law is generally the only way to legitimate touching peoples rivate matters in this way, and already requires a distinction between family and not-family in its own.</p>
<p>However, as shown in the corresponding sub-section in the section above, the main issue to consider regarding couples within the same family are their children who might be troubled by only having one set of grandparents and/or aunts/uncles, so a more specific, even less overnuking way to face the problem would be to</p>
<ul width="scales"><li>legally ban people who have less than 3 parents in total or less than a required amount of siblings from getting (including children got via adoption) children, to prevent children from suffering under a destabilizing lack of famiyl members.</li></ul>
<p>These two suggested groups of measurements are still problematic insofar as they discriminate blood-related people from the same family, since non-blood-related people from the same family, such as adopted people who still form a part of the families bound, would not be affected by them, which is defeating the purpose of these laws which is to protect families from harm inflicted by unpredictable relationships forming within them. Bypassing this problem by unconditionally sanctioning inner-familar relationships such as the relationship between adopted family members and non-adopted family members is impracticable, since this would require either sanctioning pre-existant relationships or ascertain when two people started their relationship.</p>
<p>This problem makes these law suggestions more unfair than not sanctioning inner-familiar incest at all, yet less unfair that sanctioning incest in general regardless of context.</p>

<p>This does not reuire any legal measurements, since it will, as shown above, not happen. And even if a government wanted to absolutely ensure incestuous relationships don't start to outnumber non-incestuous ones, it could still</p>
<ul width="scales"><li>pass a law that all incest localizations are promptly revoked once incestuous relationships bypass n% of all existent relationships,</li></ul>
<p>where n is an integer between 1 and 99. This measurement could, for example, be implemented based on statistics, since statistics about the ratio of same-sex couples in society are usually relatively accureate and so could be statistics about incestual couples if they wheren't silenced by discrimination.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As shown in the section "Tower defense", the legal concept of "Sittenwiedrigkeit" is pretty problematic when applied to sexual relationships, and should not be taken as a legal argument regarding them, especially since it was originally established for economic contracts and not to judge the morality of sexual actions. Thus, any law to address the issue of "Sittenwiedrigkeit" in incest would be inherently problematic.</p>
<p>ToDo: Move the "especially since"-part up into the tower defense section IF we decide to mention it there and it fits.</p>

<p>This "issue" does not require legal consideration since we live in a secular state and religious states are generally regimes of religious oppression and can't be reasoned with about personal freedom and the individuals self-realization, and thus, don't need consideration.</p>

<p>This is wrong, and if one wanted to address it, sanctioning paedophilia, which, surprise, is already rightfully sanctioned in most states, would suffice to do so.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>This is wrong, but properly communicating that it is wrong is still an absolute necessity when legalizing incest and should be taken into consideration when doing so.</p>
<p>As we can see, every concern regarding the possible unbanning of incest can be addressed with a law that's more specific that universally targetting incest, infringes less on the peoples freedom and targets more on the specific issues in question. There are good answers to all of the problems used to justify the universal incest ban, and none of these answers is to universally ban incest.</p>
<p>Before we continue with our analysation of search results and german law to show the arguments we analysed aren't strawmen, we will take a critical look at some meta implications of the german incest ban and anti-incest laws in general.</p>
<h2>
<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#meta-considerations" id="user-content-meta-considerations"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Meta considerations</h2>
<p>The amount of people in consentual incestuous relationships might certainly be low, even if we take the dark figure into account, so legalizing incest will probably have a minor impact from an utilitarian perspective. However, the way society threats incest has a lot of negative side implications regardless of its implications for people in incestuous relationships. These implications are partly merely symptoms of bigger problems, partly means to legitimize problematic concepts, and partly intertwined with issues on whom legalizing incest might help to shed more light.</p>
<p>I'm going to iterate over some of these issues, most of whom where already mentioned during this essay, to give a brief summary of the negative implications intertwined with the incest-taboo, and show why breaking it is important not only for the victims of incest criminalization, but also for society as a whole. You might not neccessarily agree to all of them, since the way people weight implications is heighly dependant on their political allignment, but some of them might be worth consideration for you:</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Many of the arguments used against incest are passed down from sexual minority to sexual minority, reused on every single one of them and then reused on the next one once the surpressed minority manages to break its chains. These arguments include, but are not limited, to</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>naturalist arguments (along the lines of "it is not intended by nature, so humans should not do it either"),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Gute Sitten" and "Sittenwiedrigkeit" (as legal concepts in germany),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using the existance of a taboo to legitimate the continuous existence of said taboo,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>tradition,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>arguing that legalizing consensual, yet sanctioned, legal acts was a slippery slope into legalizing pedophilia,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and they where used to illegalize, criminalize and/or suppress</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>adultery,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>"Kupplerei", which was german for helping people organize premarital intercourse by providing rooms or other aids,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>premarital intercourse,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>same-sex sexual interactions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>for a long time. The problem here is that these arguments appear to be appliable to every form of sexual or romantical action as long as it doesn't conform with the majorities sense of what is desirable and what is not, and are thus essentially begging to be abused for discrimination against minorities. One might expect people to realise that a set of arguments systematically used for criminalizing things that later turn out to be completely legitimate might not be a good set of arguments for arguing about anything even remotely connected to sex. However, there was never a broad social discussion about these arguments in general, and some of these, such as "gute Sitten", are still amongst the pillars our laws are build on.</p>
<p>This is</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>disrespectfull towards every minority ever surpressed with these arguments, since assuming "foo is against moral standards" to be a good arguments for criminalizing foo questions the legalization of homosexuality and others, who where also once criminalized based on "homosexuality is against moral standards" and similar arguments,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>problematic, because had the very idea of using highly abstracts and tradition-oriented moral concepts such as "Sitten" as a legal argument been questioned earlier, lots of discrimination of lots of minorities would've been over much faster, and these problematic arguments still being used to legitimize oppression even against nonexistant minorities sends a very wrong signal and invites for contiuous use to legitimate oppressive structures,</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>which is why legalizing incest would break the last big taboo legitimated (or at least partly legitimated) by these arguments, and thereby</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>send a signal,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>maybe open space for a discussion about these issues,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>destroy the last precedent that might be usable for arguing that these arguments still have legal relevance when discussing sexuality-related topics,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>take one important and required step for working through our societies dark history of oppressing sexual minorities with these arguments,</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>of whom the later one is our duty and the first three ones are absolutely necessary for fighting instances of discrimination against upcoming minorities such as furries or polyamourous people, who risk to face the same malicious arguments countless minorities have faced before them.</p>

<p>We already discussed it in the "Tower Defense"-section regarding the argument of inbreed creating sick children, so I won't dive into it in-deph right now, but to recap, the main points to consider here are that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>preventing children from coming into existance based on possible genetical disorders is heighly debated and possibly questioning the worth of people with genetical disorders compared to people without them,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>preventing people from getting children based on possible genetical disorders is heighly debatable considering the fact that such measurements would mainly affect people with genetical disorders, many of whom are heredetary, and thus discriminate against an already discriminated minority and effectively mirror the forced sterilizations performed by Nazis in the 3rd rich as well as the mindset associated with it. The fact that only relatives are prevented from procreating based on eugenetic considerations, yet genetically disposed people are not, does not do anything to put this problematic message into perspective or make the mindset communicated through it any less problematic, but instead renders the reasoning more arbitrarily.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both issues are essentially opposite sides of a coin, one of them downvaluing genetically disposed children, one of them downvaluing geneticalyl disposed adults, and both of them together forming a whole.</p>
<p>And both issues harbor a mindset of ranking the desirability of different states of existence and different people to exist based on genetical dispositions, and the fact that they arise and how they arise from the incest debate shows that</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>apparently, an issue being judged with a modern liberal mindset opposed to the one described above is not available if the issue does not get enough public attention and does not have an active community fighting for modern approaches to the issue,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>apparently, eugenetic law legitimations are still acceptable in germany as long as it is "for the welth of children", which can be, sadly, used as an argument for pretty much every type of eugenetics.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of are indicators of a two-faced policy, a twisted mindset trenching the german political landscape, which tries to distance itself from the eugenetics of nazi germany and any form of negative implication towards genetically disposed minorities, but at the same time doesn't want people to be born genetically disposed or to be genetically disposed ain general, and thus, twists its mindset depending on wheather it is dealing in the realms of publical attention or in the pits of deinterest that surround issues such as inbreed. It is the lack of a clear course and the two-faced approach that I am critizising here, the fact that whatever there might be of a course appears to depend on the amount of public attention an issue gets and not on on general considerations about the way society should thread genetically disposed people, that I am critizising here.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I must admit that this is somewhat vague and that the incest ban is not representative enough to draw conclusions out of it on its own, but the regressive arguing used for defending it still raises this suspicion. Judiciary and legislative arguing pretty much tangential to the argumentive figures commonly used by the general public when it comes to eugenetics and sexualities fuels the budding suspicion that some legal organs don't even try to appear progressive and modern in their reasoning as long as no one is looking, which is concerning because it once again reminds us that legal organs can get really regressive as soon as noone cares about their doings, and that an interested, critical general public is fundamentally important for enforcing social progress and hindering legal authorities from acting regressive.</p>
<p>To be clear, the issue is not that legal authorities such as the <em>Federal Instance Court</em> in germany or the <em>European Court of Human Rights</em> decided against legalizing incest. The problem is that they debated their decisions using an regressive and problematic set of values, as shown in point 1 and 2 of this section, and that said values are tangential to the point society is heading towards right now. This indicates that either, legal authorities or at least those in courts are painfully unaware of social developements and issues, or that they decide to ignore them and base their decisions on not-so-modern mindsets as soon as they feel like the general public does not care enough about it. It demonstrates that judges are old white men with the values of old white men, and that always keeping an eye on them and their decisions is absolutely nessesary.</p>
<p>Democracy moves only forwards for as long as the people keep an eye on those in charge, and the antiquity of some of the arguments used against incest legalization in court once again demonstrates this issue. We can draw one important conclusion from this: That the general public not caring is good enough of a reason to care oneself, because if noone cares, the court will neither.</p>

<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#why-rejecting-shadows-is-not-required-for-good-minimalistic-design" id="user-content-why-rejecting-shadows-is-not-required-for-good-minimalistic-design"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why rejecting shadows is NOT required for good minimalistic design</h1>
<p>I happen to browse the internet quite a lot, even more so when I am procrastinating. And since most of my knowledge comes from me procrastinating and thus googling useless stuff, most of my knowledge consists of .html files, tidily well-ordered in shelves within my brain. Said html happens to usually contain some css to make it look younger than 2002, and said css usually uses minimalistic design. Which I actually love because it hurts my eyes less than your average windows 7 window manager.</p>
<p>What I don't love, however, is people thinking their minimalistic design gets any better by not applying shadow to anything, making everything flat and looking like a piece of cheap inlaying artwork (looking at you, microsoft website). There is a reason why lots of design principles like Material Design place value on the layering of elements using shadow; the reason being <strong>not applying shadow is not required to achieve minimalistic design.</strong></p>
<p>When we think about minimalist design, what pops up in our minds are often minimalist frontpages of photographers web presences with only two words, a link and a small sprinkle of color to accentuate. However, minimalist web design can also encapsulate complex blogs, tools, forums, news sites and services that naturally have a lot of information to serve. We tend to forget (partly because of what is usually shown as examples of minimalist design and what isn't) that minimalist design does not mean showing little, but showing less, only the necessities, rid of all distractions. Minimalistic does not necessarily imply that there is vey little going on, but that what is going on is reduced to the minimal amount of overload possible whilst still serving its information.</p>
<p>The question if shadows can -and thus should- be omitted in minimalist design is easily answered with a yes when talking about really small and naturally information-light things such as frontpages, but it is far more complex when talking about naturally information-heavy things like blogs with a handful of necessary gui-elements for easy navigation, and I feel like people tend to ignore these cases and wrongly assume that shadows can -and thus, should- always be omitted even in these complex cases.</p>
<p>And they are wrong.</p>
<p>To prove my point, I'll take the central principle of minimalist design, the central idea that binds all derivatives of minimalist design, be it in physical art or be it in web design, together, and derive possible legitimations for said idea from a deductional standpoint as if I'd never even heard of minimalist design. Follow me open-minded and try to ignore your budding scepticism until I get to explain the reasons for this approach later on.</p>
<p>One of the most refreshing aspects of minimalist design is, from a linguistic standpoint, that the word itself is minimalistic. It's not an euphemism, it's not a summary, but it is in itself a throughout description of what divides minimalist design from other design principles:</p>
<p>Minimalist design is simply design that is minimalistic, and since minimalism is pretty well-defined, we can formulate the principle of minimalist design as</p>
<pre><code>important things &gt; important things + unimportant things
</code></pre>
<p>As you might have noticed, something being unimportant does not necessarily imply something being bad on its own. After all, having something unimportant is always better than having nothing. Whilst this might still be somewhat opinionated and can surely be debated, we can still assume that content provided in a web format, if its necessity is actively debated, is not actively worse than nothing - if it was actively BAD on its own, said badness should usually be recognized and the element removed before even questioning its compliance with minimalistic design.</p>
<p>Which is why we can assume that</p>
<pre><code>unimportant thing &gt; 0
</code></pre>
<p>The question this raises is how an unimportant things better than nothing can be worse than if it wasn't there at all once it is in conjunction with important things.</p>
<p>The only valid reasons are that either (a) unimportant things get better if one has nothing else, (b) they get worse if one has important things with them, and (c) important things get worse if they are in conjunction with less important things. You will have noticed that (b) and (c) are distict in that (b) is about the unimportant thing being denigrated by the important one and (c) about being the other way round.</p>
<p>Let's look at all of these and show why only one of them makes sense:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(a) <code>unimportant things get better if one has nothing else</code> : True, but not applying to shadows due to the supportive nature of shadows - a shadow is always cast by something, supporting it, and pretty much worthless on its own or even incapable of existing in and on itself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(b) <code>unimportant things get worse if one has importat things with them</code> : Nah, I don't think so. The good things might distract us from the unimportant things, but not focusing on something does not make it necessarily bad. Or, to be more specifically, shadows don get worse if one doesn't look at them, since they are not intended to be intensively focused on in the first place. Removing something unimportant out of fear an important thing might distract from it is generally useless on its own since it is in the very nature of unimportant things that being distracted from them does no harm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(c) <code>important things get worse if they are in conjunction with less important things</code> : If the important thing is to communicate something, this holds true. The reason why the unimportant thing might take away from the important thing is, analogous to point (b), that it distract from it. After all, whatever one intends to communicate should be focused on by the reader, and said focus being taken away by something thus takes away from the important thing intended to be focused.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Conclusively, we can agree on precisely one valid reasoning for the equation at the core of minimalist design, and use said reasoning -minimalist design attempting to remove distractions- to make a list of different "distraction types", on which we may be able to allocate the interaction between shadow and narrative to see if, and in which way, shadows might be distractive, and if the way in which they are distractive violates the reasoning behind minimalist design:</p>
<pre><code>(i)   important things distracting from unimportant things
(ii)  important things distracting from important things
(iii) unimportant things distracting from unimportant things
(iv)  unimportant things distracting from important things
</code></pre>
<p>But first, we will rule out which one of these distraction types it is we have to fear:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(i) <code>important things distracting from unimportant things</code> : Well... yeah, that's kinda what we want, isn't it? I mean, we want the reader to focus on what's important, and if we get them to unfocus on the useless stuff around them at the same time, that's twice the win. So nothing wrong with that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(ii) <code>important things distracting from important things</code> : Imagine having two important things. Let's call them <code>foo</code> and <code>bar</code>, as all important things are called. We know that one of them will distract from the other one. Now we have two options: Leave one of them out, or bot leave one of them out. If we leave one of them out, the user will only concentrate on one of them since only one of them is left. If we don't leave one of them out, the user will concentrate on one of them, ad leave the other one out. Nothing changes. However, the option to leave something out is simply not an option if we are talking about important things. It's out of scope. I mean, look at this text. Its uppe rhalf is distracting from its lower half (which it really is, I mean, thee is actually no need to see everything one has already read on the upper half of the screen whilst reading the lower half), so if we leave it out, the reader will be less distracted from this essays lower half. I'm not being sarcastic here, I realy mean it: Deleting huge portions of this essay would seriously help remove distraction from the rest of it. Would it be a good idea, though? No, because both halves of the essay are important, and leaving one important thing away to not distract from the other important thing seriously impacts the message you want your pair of important things to communicate, together, united.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(iii) <code>unimportant things distracting from unimportant things</code> : This ain't gonna hurt no one, since being distracted from something unimportant is inherently not a bad thing. After all, it is unimportant. If one distracts the reader from something unimportant, one just replaces one unimportant thing with another. I mean, they both shouldn't have been there in the first place, but who cares if they suddenly decide to switch places in the viewers mind?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(iv) <code>unimportant things distracting from important things</code> : This is a real thread. You want to communicate something, and something else distracts from it. That's not what you want.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Accordingly, we can assume that the only reason shadows might contradict the reasoning behind minimalist design is reason (iv).</p>
<p>Now, you might raise the question why we went through all these loosely-shadow-related deductions about the nature of minimalist design up there, and that's a pretty valid question since we could've gotten to this point a lot faster by just stating that minimalist design is legitimated by the urge and need to remove distractions, which it is, according to most designers and design specifications. We would've, however, missed two important points by doing so:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Jumping straight to the reason why minimalist design is generally useful does not allow us to show that other logically derivable reasons are bad reasons, which would not allow us to redeem shadows based on one specific legitimation of minimalist design, but instead require us to show their compliance with a multitude of possible legitimations of minimalist design. We basically just ensured no smartass can come along and be like "Well, you showed that shadows don't defy the idea of minimalist design based on its most common legitimation, but here I am proclaiming that minimalist design can also be legitimated by [insert a, b, i, ii or iii]".</p>
<p>This was what we generated (a), (b) and (c) for.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We ended up creating a list of possible nemeses of minimalist design, and showed that all of them except for one aren't generally dreadful, which allows us to easily argue whether applying shadow to UI elements is inherently dreadful to good minimalist design or not by checking if it falls under the "dreadful distraction-type" iv or not.</p>
<p>This was what we generated (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) for.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Our reasoning and its necessity might be best illustrated by a tree with two different levels, one for (1) and one for (2):</p>
<p><a href="/phseiff-essays/images/shadow-nosferatu-logic-tree-gimp-edited.png" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><img alt="Tree of minimalist reasoning and nemeses" data-canonical-src="/phseiff-essays/images/shadow-nosferatu-logic-tree-gimp-edited.png" src="/phseiff-essays/images/shadow-nosferatu-logic-tree-gimp-edited.png" srcset="/phseiff-essays/images/shadow-nosferatu-logic-tree-gimp-edited.500px.jpeg 500w, /phseiff-essays/images/shadow-nosferatu-logic-tree-gimp-edited.794px.jpeg 794w, " style="max-width:100%;"/></a></p>
<p>After showing the dread shadows might pose as well as our reasoning, we can finally rule out which, if any, distraction type shadows fall into, and thus, if they are truly dreadful.</p>
<p>To do so, we can assume we have two things:</p>
<pre><code>things1 = shadows
things2 = something (partially) styled by using shadows
</code></pre>
<p>Of these two assumptions, the existence of <code>thing1</code> is pretty much the premise of the entire discussion and can thus be assumed, and the existence of <code>thing2</code> follows since a shadow never comes alone; it's always drawn by something. We can assume that nothing else except <code>thing1</code> and <code>thing2</code> exists, since the "(partially)"-part in the definition of <code>thing2</code> allows <code>thing2</code> to cover the entirety of things that are not shadows.</p>
<p>We don't actually need to know which case -case (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv)- we can assign this scenario to; all we need to know is if said case is case (iv) or not. For case (iv) to hold true, one of the following must apply:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>thing1 is important, thing2 is unimportant, and thing2 distracts from thing1</code></p>
<p>This would require <code>thing1</code> -the shadows- to be of higher importance than <code>thing2</code> -the rest.</p>
<p>However, since shadows themselves are pretty much useless on their own -as said before, even the very capability of shadows to exist on their own can be debated-, and since shadows usually have a supportive character in communication since they add to something instead of being something other things add information too, we can safely assume that <code>thing1</code> is of equal or lower importance than <code>thing2</code>. If the shadow was more important than what draws it, the rightful question could be raised how an accent can be more important than the letter it thrones on, an underline more important than the word it underlines, <em>a spotlight more important than what it is shed on</em>, to which there is no satisfying answer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>thing1 is unimportant, thing2 is important, and thing1 distracts from thing2</code>:</p>
<p>This case is easily contradicted by showing that <code>thing1</code> -the shadows- are not unimportant.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Case (1) is already contradicted, and to additionally contradict case (2), all that must be shown is that shadows are not unimportant.</p>
<p>And yes, they are not. Because shadows do not distract from communication, they <strong>do</strong> communication. Applying a shadow to something usually shows that it is supposed to be closer to the reader that whatever lays behind it, like something being stickied to a surface. And something being stickied to a surface, like a sticker, usually conveys a message about the surface, something which should be taken in relation of this surface. For example, a sticker with a price contains a message about the thing the sticker is stickied to (how much it costs), and a banner containing an icon usually means that whatever it is stickied to falls under the category symbolized by said icon. By making a banner showing an icon or some text flat, the user does not see if they are looking at the icon through a window or if it is in front of the surface surrounding it. Essentially, the user gets less information on what relates to what and what is more important than what. Shadow adds a third dimension to a text, a gui, to literally anything you want to display on a flat thing like a paper or a screen, and more dimension means more room to use placement to communicate your ideas. So shadow is not an unimportant thing. It is part of what you are doing, not just decoration, because it helps you communicate what you want to communicate, and that is what design is all about. Removing shadow because it might distract from the rest is like removing half of this essay because it distracts from the other half.</p>
<p>In case you have lost track of this somewhat curvy line of thought, here is the route back to where we came from:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>We have now shown that shadows are not unimportant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, applying shadows does not trigger case iv.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thus, they are not a nemesis of minimalist design.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And what can be a nemesis of minimalist design was ruled out beforehand based on a good legitimation for the existence of minimalist design, and the question what defies that legitimation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And that this legitimation is the only really good one there is was shown at the beginning by using the underlying idea of minimalist design: minimalism in general.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#-tower-defense" id="user-content--tower-defense"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>‚ôú Tower defense</h2>
<p>Building a castle is worth nothing if one does not defend it afterwards, and the same goes for essays. There are always things that don't fit in, as well as counter arguments who are inherently covered by ones arguing, yet might still come up. Sometimes, the coverage of counter arguments slips the attention of the reader, and sometimes, a counterpoint is better addressed in a defensive style than in an offensive style. Sometimes, you write an essay, and you can already see a very specific counter argument coming when you write it. And sometimes, instead of incorporating said argument into ones line of thought and arguments, it's easier and keeps the text from being cluttered and distracted to just prove it wrong after the line of thought is finally delivered.</p>
<p>If I covered a specific cornercase, yet I know people are going to miss that and come back to it, I technically covered that argument, yet it might still be worth talking about the argument at the end of the essay nonetheless. And likewise, if I know that a specific, pretty likely counterargument to my essay is logically flawed, it <em>technically</em> poses no "harm" to my argumentation, yet it might still be worth talking about the argument at the end of the essay to show how it is flawed.</p>
<p>That's why I will divide all of my essays into two parts: One main part with constructive reasoning for what I try to show, and one purely defensive part where I respond to some potential counterarguments to either show that they are logically flawed or that the point they make was already covered by my reasoning in the first part and is, in fact, not an argumentation hole. The second part might also grow after I released an essay as new arguments pile up.</p>
<p>So let's get started with this essays tower defensefind:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Minimalist design gets along without overlapping elements if it is well-done, so shadows are not needed to add a third dimension.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In fact, websites are usually scrollable, especially if they contain huge amounts of text. And sometimes, huge amounts of text are necessary, simply because text tends to be made out of text and people tend to read this stuff. Dynamically loading text instead of having a scrollbar is often not an option either, because sometimes, you don't want to rely on javascript, and to be honest, scrolling text is pretty damn useful.</p>
<p>The problem is that, even in scrollable websites, there might still be a need for some elements to be permanently visible. This includes cookie banners that legally need to inform the visitors of cookies until they click "okay" or "x" as well as up- or down-buttons needed to get back to the top of the page really fast, or gui elements if what you are scrolling through can be edited like a document in a text editor.</p>
<p>If you have elements that stay where they are whilst all other elements can be scrolled, it's crucial to communicate that these elements are always in front of other elements so the user gets exactly the behavior they expect, and this can -for example- be done by using shadows for elements with fixed positions. So "elements will never overlap each other if minimalist design is done properly" is pretty simplifying.</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Emphasizing things (e.g. with shadows) when there are only necessary things on the screen is not required.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is false when talking about buttons, since only necessary elements being on a screen does not mean that they don't deserve different amounts of focus. Every element moved from a screen means that it takes more time to reach one more element with your mouse, so moving EVERYTHING except for one thing off the page is usually not an option. For example, if there is an "Okay"-button, there's usually also a "Cancel"-button around, and whilst one of these might deserve more emphasisis to communicate that it is supposed to be the default option, removing the other one from the page would seriously break things. Efficiency in button pressing sometimes forces us to put more things on a page, and more things force us to add emphasises on some things.</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Adding shadows to convey hierarchies is skeuomorphic and thus contradicting minimalist design.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A sceuomorphism is a design element imitating a real-life thing to communicate the way it works to the user, such as the grips on the scrollbars in Windows 7 or the way early OSes imitated plastic buttons with their buttons. And yes, sceuomorphisms are usually too opulent to be minimalistic, and tend to loose their relevance as time progresses and people get increasingly accustomed to the abstract concepts behind computer screens, as can be seen by the increasing foremarch of abstract (sometimes minimalist) design philosophies. However, what stems from history (sceuomorphic) and the ideal solution to a problem (minimalism) can sometimes overlap or even be the same. Let's take paper as an example: Paper is usually white and written on with black lettering. Texts on desktop screens are also white and covered in black letters, words and sentences. We can assume that this is for historical reasons, a sceuomorphism if I ever have seen one, yet this coloring also happens to be the ideal one even though computer screens allow other ones. Yes, one might argue that dark mode was better than light mode, but we could still assume that white mode is better and make this a thought experiment, and the reasoning would still work. This shows that something originating as a sceuomorphism does not necessarily make it non-minimalist.</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>The amount of things being conveyable by shadows is limited to adding a third dimension and emphasizing things.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is broadly simplifying. Generally, a shadow can have any radius/intensity from 0 (no shadow at all) to whatever number. Thus, a shadow can communicate any scalar property a thing might have, such as its importance or z-position, but also its nestling depth (useful for comments) or even more special cases such as its evilness or the time remaining until it automatically disappears. Limiting shadows to two thinkable usages when they can communicate really any number property is boldly uncreative.</p>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote>
<p>Your definition of "important" and "unimportant" are arbitrary.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No, they are not, because I <strong>have</strong> no specific definition of the concept of importance. All I am assuming is that importance is a scalar property measured subjectively by the one who judges it (the artist or web designer attempting to communicate something and placing different value on different things), and that said person draws a line between "important" and "unimportant" based on the importance of a thing at an arbitrary, yet somewhat constant, point, which is something generally possible for any scalar property.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After responding to some possible counter arguments (or maybe strawmen?) to the point I am making, I'd like to drop some words about my motivation for writing this essay and making it the first one on my website.</p>
<p>In general, I don't care too much about minimalist design and its use of shadows. It's not a topic I hold especially dear, or one that I can rant about for hours. Yet that's the reason why I made it my first essay: To try out the format, introduce concepts such as the Tower Defense, and show my way of thinking: to focusing on dividing questions into abstract logical problems, dividing these into different logical cases, and reassemble these afterwards, instead of weighting pros and cons against each other. I also made this essay to test out my website's coding and see if it will be correctly displayed -after all, I coded everything myself- and to get some opinions from acquaintances before I dedicate myself to more important topics.</p>
<h2>
<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#final-words" id="user-content-final-words"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Final words</h2>
<p>Shadows are not automatically evil, they are not some kind of confetti sprinkled around a webpage, but actively communicate things. If used correctly, they are not some kind of decoration, not some marker to put emphasis on a button, but something that actively communicates. As they say, a shadow can say more than a thousand words. I hope that I was able to fight some prejudices against shadows in UI design, and you might have gotten somewhat closer to forgiving me for all the shadows on my website thorough this essay.</p>
